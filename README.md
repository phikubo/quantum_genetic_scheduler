# Quantum Genetic Scheduler Simulation
## Quantum Scheduler for Wireless Simulators (4G, 5G).

This scripts shows the way to find the optimal resource allocation for users for which throughput is calculated based in resource blocks (chunks of frecuency) and modulation (a sort of channel indicator). We use Qiskit for the Knapsack Algorithm and Deap for the Genetic Algorithm.

This scripts are developed upon the Qiskit Fall Fest IPN Mexico.
